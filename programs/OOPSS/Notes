4 pillers
1.inheritance : relation between two entity can be direct/indirect
is relation(inheritance)-- extending
types :single,multilevel,hierarchical,multiple
has a relation(aggregation)
------------------------
2.polymorphism :many forms 
overriding : same method name, same datatype or no of paramter using inheritance

overloading: same method name, differenece - datatype or no of parameters

----------------
3.abstraction : show imp & hide  complex details
Ex: You can start a car by turning the key or pressing the start button. 
	You don't need to know how the engine is getting started, what all components your car has. 
	The car internal implementation and complex logic is completely hidden from the user
---------------------------------
4.Encapsulation : to safe/give protection/wrapping up of code and data under a single unit
Ex :capsule. This capsule mixes few types of medicines and stored in one capsule.

--------------------------------------
super: refer parent class property, contructor, method in child class
Ex :Parent class: Vehicle
	Child class: Car
	Child class access certain properties and behaviors of Parent class
----------------------------
this keyword :this is a reference variable that refers to the current object. 
ex :Imagine a classroom where a teacher calls out a student's name. 
	If multiple students have the same name (e.g., anita), 
	it's important for each anita to identify himself as this anita to avoid confusion.
-----------------------
final keyword :A final variable cannot be modified once it has been initialized.
ex: Imagine a school where a student's roll number is assigned once 
	and never changes during their time at the school.
